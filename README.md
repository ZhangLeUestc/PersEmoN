## Requirements
- [MTCNN](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment)  
We use the MTCNN to first detect and align the faces. We used two customized layers which may not be included in the official caffe.
- [TSN](https://github.com/yjxiong/temporal-segment-networks)  
Used in Videodata layer.

Also, For the "DomainConfusionInnerProduct" layer, we get the code from the following paper: ["Simultaneous Deep Transfer Across Domains and Tasks."](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jhoffman/papers/Tzeng_ICCV2015.pdf), ICCV, 2015. 

As the original code for the above paper is not well-maintained, we provide the source code of "DomainConfusionInnerProduct" layer in this repository.
