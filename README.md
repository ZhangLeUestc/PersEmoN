We use the MTCNN to first detect and align the faces. The source coude of MTCNN could be found at:

https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment

We used two customized layers which may not be included in the official caffe.

Please get the source code of Videodata layer from the TSN Repository:

As for the ``DomainConfusionInnerProduct" layer, we get the code from the following paper:

Tzeng, Eric, et al. "Simultaneous deep transfer across domains and tasks." Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision. 2015.

As the original code for the above paper is not well-maintained, we provide the source code of ``DomainConfusionInnerProduct" layer in this repository.
